# LibraryManagementSystem
This is project I did back during my A-Levels. Done using VB6 EE. Used MS Office '97 for data manipulations.
How to run the project:
 > Create a new folder in drive D named "Library Management System" -without the quotes.
 > Copy all the files there
 > Click on Library Management System.exe with the mainframe icon. If you don't know what a mainframe is, I don't know why you even bother to code. :P


To see the source code make sure you have VB6 EE installed in your PC and run the LMS.vbp
If you are here for your own A-Levels I highly discourage you from copying the code.
Thank you.
